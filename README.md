# Local_binomial_pattern
Local Binomial Pattern is a feature extractor that can be applied on images.
This study is on the classification of UAV collected plant images using our proposed lightweight Local Binomial Pattern feature extractor. It consists of the following steps, respectively.  
#1. Data collect and dataset
UAV Ã¼zerindeki 
#2. Dataset samples
#3. image histogram
#4. lbp + histogram
#5. lbip + histograam
#6. lbip + histogram + SVM
#7. lbip + histogram + NCA + SVM
